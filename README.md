# Tomato-Diseases-Identification-using-CNN-Deep-Learning-
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to create models and classify images. Python is used as a programming language as it processes a high volume of data quickly and which has the best framework such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The input data focuses mainly on the tomato plant category which there are ten different types of tomato plant diseases as researched so far that occur in plants and those diseases type is mentioned in this research. A CNN has been considered the best option for model development as it produced the results with a higher accuracy level. Mainly two different CNN techniques are used to train the model and they are CNN model with Data Augmentation and Image Data Generator. Results are evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, f1-score, recall, confusion matrix, time and epochs used for the training.
