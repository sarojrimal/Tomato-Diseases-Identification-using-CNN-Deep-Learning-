# Inroduction
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to create models and classify images. Python is used as a programming language as it processes a high volume of data quickly and which has the best framework such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The input data focuses mainly on the tomato plant category which there are ten different types of tomato plant diseases as researched so far that occur in plants and those diseases type is mentioned in this research. A CNN has been considered the best option for model development as it produced the results with a higher accuracy level. Mainly two different CNN techniques are used to train the model and they are CNN model with Data Augmentation and Image Data Generator. Results are evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, f1-score, recall, confusion matrix, time, and epochs used for the training.


# Conclusion
In conclusion, this study successfully developed and tested two CNN models: one with Data Augmentation and another with Image Data Generator. The effectiveness and performance of data augmentation and Image Data Generator were evaluated using testing image samples and new unseen images.
Both models were trained and evaluated using the same dataset, which was split into training, validation, and testing sets. Accuracy, precision, f1-score, and recall were measured and compared for evaluation purposes. Additionally, the confusion matrix, number of epochs used for training, and training time were considered. Due to the limited computational resources, the training time for the CNN models was relatively longer.
Data augmentation proved to be a valuable technique, particularly when dealing with limited or unbalanced datasets. It enhanced the model's performance by introducing variations and helping it learn more reliable characteristics, thus minimizing overfitting. The model with data augmentation achieved the highest accuracy compared to the Image Data Generator.
Overall, this study provides valuable insights and practical implications for utilizing CNN models in plant disease classification tasks, and it contributes to the advancement of deep learning techniques in agriculture and mobile applications.
